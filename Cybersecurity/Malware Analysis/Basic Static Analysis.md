Since a PE file's information can be easily extracted using a Hex editor or a tool like pe-tree, it becomes undesirable for people who don't want their code to be reverse-engineered. This is where the packers come in. A packer is a tool to obfuscate the data in a PE file so that it can't be read without unpacking it. In simple words, packers pack the PE file in a layer of obfuscation to avoid reverse engineering and render a PE file's static analysis useless. When the PE file is executed, it runs the unpacking routine to extract the original code and then executes it. Legitimate software developers use packing to address piracy concerns, and malware authors use it to avoid detection. So how do we identify packers?

### From Section Headers

In the previous tasks, we learned that commonly, a PE file has a .text section, a .data section, and a .rsrc section, where only the .text section has the execute flag set because it contains the code. Now take the example of the file named zmsuz3pinwl. When we open this file in pe-tree, we find that it has unconventional section names (or no names, in this case).

![IMAGE_SECTION_HEADERS as seen in the pe-tree utility, showing abnormal sections](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/ae6603f0316ce4c6f7d7c4063f99cd09.png)

We might think this has something to do with the tool we use to analyze the file. Therefore, let's check it using another PE analysis tool called pecheck. The pecheck tool provides the same information we have been gathering from the pe-tree tool, but it is a command-line tool. We navigate to the Desktop\Samples directory in the terminal and give the following command to run the pecheck tool.

`pecheck zmsuz3pinwl`

Let's see the information in the PE Sections heading in the output:

```

We see here that the section name is empty, and it is not a glitch in the tool we used to analyze the PE file.

Another thing that we might notice here is that the Entropy of the .data section and three of the four unnamed sections is higher than seven and is approaching 8. As we discussed in a previous task, higher Entropy represents a higher level of randomness in data. Random data is generally generated when the original data is obfuscated, indicating that these values might indicate a packed executable.

Apart from the section names, another indicator of a packed executable is the permissions of each section. For the PE file in the above terminal, we can see that the section contains initialized data and has READ, WRITE and EXECUTE permissions. Similarly, some other sections also have READ, WRITE and EXECUTE permissions. This is also not found in the ordinary unpacked PE file, where only the .text section has EXECUTE permissions, as we saw in the redline malware sample.

Another valuable piece of information from the section headers to identify a packed executable is the SizeOfRawData and Misc_VirtualSize. In a packed executable, the SizeOfRawData will always be significantly smaller than the Misc_VirtualSize in sections with WRITE and EXECUTE permissions. This is because when the PE file unpacks during execution, it writes data to this section, increasing its size in the memory compared to the size on disk, and then executes it.

### From Import functions:

The last important indicator of a packed executable we discuss here is its import functions. The redline PE file we analyzed earlier imported lots of functions, indicating the activity it potentially performs. However, for the PE file zmsuz3pinwl, we will see only a handful of imports, especially the GetProcAddress, GetModuleHandleA, and LoadLibraryA. These functions are often some of the only few imports of a packed PE file because these functions provide the functionality to unpack the PE file during runtime.

![The imports of an executable as seen using the pe-tree utility, showing very less imported functions](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/8b7549ef9f8a18ea2fa1325a9f26da0f.png)

Summing up, the following indications point to a packed executable when we look at its PE header data:

- Unconventional section names
- EXECUTE permissions for multiple sections
- High Entropy, approaching 8, for some sections.
- A significant difference between SizeOfRawData and Misc_VirtualSize of some PE sections
- Very few import functions

In the [Intro to Malware Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/intromalwareanalysis) room, we identified that searching for strings is one of the first steps in malware analysis. A string search provides useful information to a malware analyst by identifying important pieces of strings present in a suspected malware sample. To learn a little more about strings, we can look at [this room](https://tryhackme.com/room/malstrings) dedicated to strings.  

## How a string search works:

A string search looks at the binary data in a malware sample regardless of its file type and identifies sequences of ASCII or Unicode characters followed by a null character. Wherever it finds such a sequence, it reports that as a string. This might raise the question that not all sequences of binary data that looks like ASCII or Unicode characters will be actual strings, which is right. Many sequences of bytes can fulfill the criteria mentioned above but are not strings of useful value; rather, they might include memory addresses, assembly instructions, etc. Therefore, a string search leads to many False Positives (FPs). These FPs show up as garbage in the output of our string search and should be ignored. It is up to the analyst to identify the useful strings and ignore the rest.

![An image of a magnifying glass magnifying part of the letters of the word 'MALWARE'](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/0c44ff09fe1baba6fbb800b8e9066805.png)

## What to look for?

Since an analyst has to identify actual strings of interest and differentiate them from the garbage, it is good to know what to look for when performing a string search. Although a lot of useful information can be unearthed in a string search, the following artifacts can be used as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and prove more useful.

- Windows Functions and APIs, like SetWindowsHook, CreateProcess, InternetOpen, etc. They provide information about the possible functionality of the malware
- IP Addresses, URLs, or Domains can provide information about possible C2 communication. The Wannacry malware's killswitch domain was found using a string search
- Miscellaneous strings such as Bitcoin addresses, text used for Message Boxes, etc. This information helps set the context for further malware analysis

## Basic String Search:

In the [Intro to Malware Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/intromalwareanalysis) room, we learned about the `strings` utility, which is pre-installed in Linux machines and can be used for a basic string search. Similarly, the FLARE VM comes with a Windows utility, `strings.exe`, that performs the same task. This Windows strings utility is part of the Sysinternals suite, a set of tools published by Microsoft to analyze different aspects of a Windows machine. Details about the strings utility can be found in [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings). The strings utility comes pre-installed in the FLARE VM attached to this room. The good thing about the command line strings utility is that it can dump strings to a file for further analysis. In the attached VM, executing the following command will perform a basic string search in a binary.

`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>strings <path to binary>`

Several other tools included in the FLARE VM can be used for string search. For example, CyberChef (Desktop>FLARE>Utilities>Cyberchef) has a recipe for basic string search as well. PEstudio (Desktop>FLARE>Utilities>pestudio) also provides a string search utility. PEstudio also provides some additional information about the strings, like, the encoding, size of the string, offset in the binary where the string was found, and a hint to guess what the string is related to. It also has a column for a blacklist, which matches the strings against some signatures.

![An image showing the interface of the tool PEStudio](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/515900e121ff6b875d52b20fbe12c573.png)  
  

The above screenshot from PEstudio shows strings found by PEstudio in a malware sample. This can be done by selecting strings in the left pane after loading the PE file in PEstudio. The blacklist here shows a bunch of Windows API calls, which PEstudio flags as potentially used in malicious processes. You can learn about these APIs using resources like [MalAPI](https://malapi.io/) or [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/?scope=Desktop&terms=queryperformancecounter).  

## Obfuscated strings:

Searching for strings often proves one of the most effective first steps in malware analysis. As seen in [the case of Wannacry](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/accidental-kill-switch-slowed-fridays-massive-ransomware-attack/), effective use of string search can often disrupt malware propagation and infection. The malware authors know this and don't want a simple string search to thwart their malicious activities. Therefore, they deploy techniques to obfuscate strings in their malware. Malware authors use several techniques to obfuscate the key parts of their code. These techniques often render a string search ineffective, i.e., we won't find much information when we search for strings. 

Mandiant (then FireEye) launched FLOSS to solve this problem, short for **F**ireEye **L**abs **O**bfuscated **S**tring **S**olver. FLOSS uses several techniques to deobfuscate and extract strings that would not be otherwise found using a string search. The type of strings that FLOSS can extract and how it works can be found in [Mandiant's blog post](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/automatically-extracting-obfuscated-strings).

To execute FLOSS, open a command prompt and navigate to the Desktop directory. From there, use the following command.

`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>floss -h`

This command will open the help page for FLOSS. We can use the following command to use FLOSS to search for obfuscated strings in a binary.

`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>floss --no-static-strings <path to binary>`

Please remember that the command might take some time to execute, and you might see what appear to be some error messages before the results are generated.

When analyzing malware, it is often required to identify unique malware and differentiate them from each other. File names can't be used for this purpose as they can be duplicated easily and might be confusing. Also, a file name can be changed easily as well. ![An image of a bug identifying itself using its fingerprint on a fingerprint machine](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/41c2130d2febd90806b5454599d0f9c3.png)Hence, a hash function is used to identify a malware sample uniquely. A hash function takes a file/data of arbitrary length as input and creates a fixed-length unique output based on file contents. This process is irreversible, as you can't recreate the file's contents using the hash. Hash functions have a very low probability (practically zero) of two files having different content but the same hash. A hash remains the same as long as the file's content remains the same. However, even a slight change in content will result in a different hash. It might be noted that the file name is not a part of the content; therefore, changing the file name does not affect the hash of a file.

Besides identifying files, hashes are also used to store passwords to authenticate users. In malware analysis, hash files can be used to identify unique malware, search for this malware in different malware repositories and databases, and as an Indicator of Compromise (IOC).

## Commonly used methods of calculating File hashes:

For identification of files, a hash of the complete file is taken. There are various methods to take the hash. The most commonly used methods are:

- Md5sum
- Sha1sum
- Sha256sum

The first two types of hashes are now considered insecure or prone to collision attacks (when two or more inputs result in the same hash). Although a collision attack for these hash functions is not very probable, it is still possible. Therefore, sha256sum is currently considered the most secure method of calculating a file hash. In the attached VM, we can see that multiple utilities calculate file hashes for us.

## Finding Similar files using hashes:

Another scenario in which hash functions help a malware analyst is identifying similar files using hashes. We already established that even a slight change in the contents of a file would result in a different hash. However, some types of hashes can help identify the similarity among different files. Let's learn about some of these.

### Imphash:

The imphash stands for "import hash". Imports are functions that an executable file imports from other files or Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs). The imphash is a hash of the function calls/libraries that a malware sample imports and the order in which these libraries are present in the sample. This helps identify samples from the same threat groups or performing similar activities. More details on the Imphash can be found on Mandiant's blog [here](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-malware-import-hashing).

We can use PEstudio to calculate the Imphash of a sample. 

![A screenshot of PEStudio utility highlighting the imphash of the opened file](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/a6b2943792824c6d9f4af73930aaf927.png)

Any malware samples with the same imports in the same order will have the same imphash. This helps in identifying similar samples. 

![A screenshot of abuse.ch website showing different malware samples having the same imphash](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/bd5faa050d85c40c8b79bbb4581ce2eb.png)

In the above screenshot from [Malware Bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse.php?search=imphash%3A756fdea446bc618b4804509775306c0d), all these samples have the same imphash. We can see that all of these samples are classified as the same malware family. We can see that their sha256 hash is vastly different and doesn't provide any information as to their similarity. However, the same imphash helps us identify that they might belong to the same family.

### Fuzzy hashes/SSDEEP:

Another way to identify similar malware is through fuzzy hashes. A fuzzy hash is a Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH). This hash is calculated by dividing a file into pieces and calculating the hashes of the different pieces. This method creates multiple inputs with similar sequences of bytes, even though the whole file might be different. More information on SSDEEP can be found on this [link](https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html).

Multiple utilities can be used in the attached VM to calculate ssdeep, like CyberChef. However, the ssdeep utility has been placed on the Desktop to make it easier. The following command shows the help menu of the utility.

Finding similar files using ssdeep

Let's calculate the hashes of all the samples in the mal directory in the attached VM.

```

We can try the other options shown in the help file per the requirement. When we have the ssdeep hashes, we can match these hashes together to identify similar files. This helps us identify similar files if we have a bulk of data. The documentation link provided above has very good examples of usage. The following terminal window shows one of the examples relevant to our use case to match files. For this, we can use the `-d` operator. The `-r` operator runs the ssdeep utility recursively, and the `-l` operator outputs relative paths of the files.

Finding matching files using ssdeep

```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>ssdeep-2.14.1\ssdeep -l -r -d Incoming Outgoing Trash
Outgoing/Corporate Espionage/Our Budget.doc matches Incoming/Budget 2007.doc (99)
Outgoing/Personnel Mayhem/Your Buddy Makes More Than You.doc matches Incoming/Salaries.doc (45)

FLARE Sun 09/18/2022 17:41:12.38
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>
```

The results show files that match each other. The number in the bracket at the end is the percentage of matches among the files.

In the previous task, we learned how hashes could identify identical files. We also found out that hashes can be changed by changing even a single byte of data in a file and how specific hashes like imphash and ssdeep help us identify file similarities. While using imphash or ssdeep provides a way to identify if some files are similar, sometimes we just need to identify if a file contains the information of interest. Hashes are not the ideal tool to perform this task.

## Signatures:![An image showing a computer display with random numbers and letters being displayed. A magnifying glass is being used to enlarge the display in one place, which spells the word 'MALWARE'](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/88c03f455d1eca955675e40b33cfcd39.png)

Signatures are a way to identify if a particular file has a particular type of content. We can consider a signature as a pattern that might be found inside a file. This pattern is often a sequence of bytes in a file, with or without any context regarding where it is found. Security researchers often use signatures to identify patterns in a file, identify if a file is malicious, and identify suspected behavior and malware family.

### Yara rules:

Yara rules are a type of signature-based rule. It is famously called a pattern-matching swiss army knife for malware researchers. Yara can identify information based on binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained within a file. TryHackMe has a [dedicated room](https://tryhackme.com/room/yara) for Yara rules if it interests you.

The security community publishes a [repository](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules) of open-source Yara rules that we can use as per our needs. When analyzing malware, we can use this repository to dig into the community's collective wisdom. However, while using these rules, please keep in mind that some might depend on context. Some others might just be used for the identification of patterns that can be non-malicious as well. Hence, just because a rule hits doesn't mean the file is malicious. For a better understanding, please read the documentation for the particular rule to identify the use case where it will be applicable in the best possible manner.

### Proprietary Signatures - AntiVirus Scans:

Besides the open-source signatures, Antivirus companies spend lots of resources to create proprietary signatures. The advantage of these proprietary signatures is that since they have to be sold commercially, there are lesser chances of False Positives (FPs, when a signature hits a non-malicious file). However, this might lead to a few False Negatives (FNs, when a malicious file does not hit any signature).

Antivirus scanning helps identify if a file is malicious with high confidence. Antivirus software will often mention the signature that the file has hit, which might hint at the file's functionality. However, we must note that despite their best efforts, every AV product in the market has some FPs and some FNs. Therefore, when analyzing malware, it is prudent to get a verdict from multiple products. The [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) website makes this task easier for us, where we can find the verdict about a file from 60+ AV vendors, apart from some very useful information. We also touched upon this topic in our Intro to Malware Analysis room. Please remember, if you are analyzing a sensitive file, it is best practice to search for its hash on Virustotal or other scanning websites instead of uploading the file itself. This is done to avoid leaking sensitive information on the internet and letting a sophisticated attacker know that you are analyzing their malware.

Since we have covered Yara rules in detail in the Yara room and Virustotal scanning in the Intro to malware analysis room, we will not cover them again here. However, the FLARE VM has another very cool tool that can be used for signature scanning. 

### Capa:

Capa is another open-source tool created by Mandiant. This tool helps identify the capabilities found in a PE file. Capa reads the files and tries to identify the behavior of the file based on signatures such as imports, strings, mutexes, and other artifacts present in the file. For further detail into the background of Capa, we can visit its [Github page](https://github.com/mandiant/capa) or Mandiant's [blog post](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/capa-automatically-identify-malware-capabilities) introducing Capa.

Using Capa is simple. On the command prompt, we just point capa to the file we want to run it against.

`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>capa mal.exe`

The `-h` operator shows detailed options.

  -r RULES, --rules RULES
                        path to rule file or directory, use embedded rules by default
  -t TAG, --tag TAG     filter on rule meta field values
  -j, --json            emit JSON instead of text

By default, capa uses a default set of embedded rules.
You can see the rule set here:
  https://github.com/fireeye/capa-rules

To provide your own rule set, use the `-r` flag:
  capa  --rules /path/to/rules  suspicious.exe
  capa  -r      /path/to/rules  suspicious.exe

examples:
  identify capabilities in a binary
    capa suspicious.exe

  identify capabilities in 32-bit shellcode, see `-f` for all supported formats
    capa -f sc32 shellcode.bin

  report match locations
    capa -v suspicious.exe

  report all feature match details
    capa -vv suspicious.exe

  filter rules by meta fields, e.g. rule name or namespace
    capa -t "create TCP socket" suspicious.exe

We can see that Capa has mapped the identified capabilities according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and [Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC)](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown). In the last table, we see the capabilities against the matched signatures and the number of signatures that have found a hit against these capabilities. As we might see, it also tells us if there are obfuscated stackstrings in the sample, allowing us to identify if running FLOSS against the sample might be helpful. To find out more information about the sample, we can use the `-v` or the `-vv` operator, which will show us the results in verbose or very verbose mode, identifying addresses where we might find the said capability.

So far in this room, we have covered techniques that work regardless of the file type of the malware. However, those techniques are a little hit-and-miss, as they don't always provide us with deterministic information about the malware. The PE headers provide a little more deterministic characteristics of the sample, which tells us much more about the sample.

## The PE header:![An image of a bug whose head is being dissected using a scalpel](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/83e849434f20772975b27d9be4c5eb90.png)

The programs that we run are generally stored in the executable file format. These files are portable because they can be taken to any system with the same Operating System and dependencies, and they will perform the same task on that system. Therefore, these files are called Portable Executables (PE files). The PE files consist of a sequence of bits stored on the disk. This sequence is in a specific format. The initial bits define the characteristics of the PE file and explain how to read the rest of the data. This initial part of the PE file is called a PE header. 

Several tools in the FLARE VM can help us analyze PE headers. PEStudio is one of them. We already familiarized ourselves with PEStudio in a previous task, so we will just use that in this task as well.  

The PE header contains rich information useful for malware analysis. We will learn about this data in detail in the [Dissecting PE headers](https://tryhackme.com/room/dissectingpeheaders) room. However, we can get the following information from a PE header as an overview.

### Linked Libraries, imports, and functions:

A PE file does not contain all of its code to perform all the tasks. It often reuses code from libraries, often provided by Microsoft as part of the Windows Operating System. Often, certain functions from these libraries are imported by the PE file. The PE header contains information about the libraries that a PE file uses and the functions it imports from those libraries. This information is very useful. A malware analyst can look at the libraries and functions that a PE file imports and get a rough idea of the functionality of a malware sample. For example, if a malware sample imports the CreateProcessA function, we can assume that this sample will create a new process.

Similarly, other functions can provide further information about the sample. However, it must be noticed that we don't know the context in which these functions are called by just looking at the PE headers. We need to dig deeper into that, which we will cover in the upcoming rooms.

PEStudio has a libraries option in the right pane, which, when selected, shows us the libraries that a PE file will use.

The functions option just below shows the functions imported from these libraries.

### Identifying Packed Executables:

As we have seen so far, static analysis bares a lot of information that can be used against the malware. Malware authors understand this as a problem. Therefore, they often go to great lengths to thwart analysis. One of the ways they can do this is by packing the original sample inside a shell-type code that obfuscates the properties of the actual malware sample. This technique is called packing, and the resultant PE file is called a packed PE file. Packing greatly reduces the effectiveness of some of the malware analysis techniques we have learned about so far. For example, if we try to search for strings in a packed executable, we might not find anything useful because of packing. Similarly, searching for similar samples using ssdeep might return more samples packed with the same packer instead of samples behaviorally similar to the sample of interest. Some signatures might also be evaded due to a malware sample being packed.

As we will see in the upcoming [Dissecting PE headers](https://tryhackme.com/room/dissectingpeheaders) room, we can identify packed executables by analyzing the PE header of a malware sample. The PE header contains important information such as the number of sections, permissions of different sections, sizes of the sections, etc. This information can give us pointers to help identify if the malware sample is packed and, if so, which type of packer has packed the executable.
