Say we have been given an IP (or multiple IP addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the “landscape” we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this “map” of the landscape is something called port scanning. When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.
 if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. Network connections are made between two ports – an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server’s port 443.

Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports. For example, a HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445. It is important to note; however, that especially in a CTF setting, it is not unheard of for even these standard ports to be altered, making it even more imperative that we perform appropriate enumeration on the target.
 
 Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan – the most common of these will be introduced in upcoming tasks; however, the basic theory is this: nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall). Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services are running on each port – either manually, or more commonly using nmap.

```
	sudo nmap  (-sT or -sS) -vv -oA -A -D --script=vuln
```
Useful nmap command explanation:
  - -vv increases verbosity of the output, more detailed and thorough
  - -oA outputs the scans in three formats
  - -A enables OS detection, version, script scanning and traceroute
  - -oG outputs in a Grep-able format
  - -T<0-5> sets the timing template, from slowest (0) to fastest (5)
  - -p- scan ALL ports
  - --script=vuln runs all pre-written scripts in the vuln category (shorthand is -sC)
  - -D to mask scans with decoys
  - --top-ports scans through the most popularly used ports
- TCP Connect Scans (`-sT`)
- SYN "Half-open" Scans (`-sS`)
- UDP Scans (`-sU`)


# TCP scans

To understand TCP Connect scans (`-sT`), it's important that you're comfortable with the _TCP three-way handshake_. If this term is new to you then completing [Introductory Networking](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking) before continuing would be advisable.

As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.

This is one of the fundamental principles of TCP/IP networking, but how does it relate to Nmap?

Well, as the name suggests, a TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn. In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.

---

For example, if a port is closed, [RFC 9293](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293) states that:

_"... If the connection does not exist (CLOSED), then a reset is sent in response to any incoming segment except another reset. A SYN segment that does not match an existing connection is rejected by this means."_

In other words, if Nmap sends a TCP request with the _SYN_ flag set to a **_closed_** port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the _RST_ (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed.

If, however, the request is sent to an _open_ port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap then marks this port as being _open_ (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set).

---

This is all well and good, however, there is a third possibility.

What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall?

Many firewalls are configured to simply **drop** incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be _filtered_.

That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:

`iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset`

This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).


# SYN scans
As with TCP scans, SYN scans (`-sS`) are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "_Half-open"_ scans, or _"Stealth"_ scans.  

Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request). In other words, the sequence for scanning an **open** port looks like this:

This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:

- It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth" scans.
- SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
- Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.

There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:

- They require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.

All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.

For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap _if run with sudo permissions_. If run **without** sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task.

---

When using a SYN scan to identify closed and filtered ports, the exact same rules as with a TCP Connect scan apply.

If a port is closed then the server responds with a RST TCP packet. If the port is filtered by a firewall then the TCP SYN packet is either dropped, or spoofed with a TCP reset.

In this regard, the two scans are identical: the big difference is in how they handle _open_ ports.

[1] SYN scans can also be made to work by giving Nmap the CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capabilities; however, this may not allow many of the NSE scripts to run properly.
