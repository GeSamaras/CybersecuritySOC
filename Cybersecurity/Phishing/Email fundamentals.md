- **SMTP** (**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** - It is utilized to handle the sending of emails. 

**POP3**

- Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.
- Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.
- Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.
- If you want to keep messages on the server, make sure the setting "Keep email on server" is enabled, or all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded to the single device's app or software.

**IMAP**

- Emails are stored on the server and can be downloaded to multiple devices.
- Sent messages are stored on the server.
- Messages can be synced and accessed across multiple devices.![[Pasted image 20240521151148.png]]

Below is an explanation of each numbered point from the above diagram:

1. Alexa composes an email to Billy (`billy@johndoe.com`) in her favorite email client. After she's done, she hits the send button.
2. The **SMTP** server needs to determine where to send Alexa's email. It queries **DNS** for information associated with `johndoe.com`. 
3. The **DNS** server obtains the information `johndoe.com` and sends that information to the **SMTP** server. 
4. The **SMTP** server sends Alexa's email across the Internet to Billy's mailbox at `johndoe.com`.
5. In this stage, Alexa's email passes through various **SMTP** servers and is finally relayed to the destination **SMTP** server. 
6. Alexa's email finally reached the destination **SMTP** server.
7. Alexa's email is forwarded and is now sitting in the local **POP3/IMAP** server waiting for Billy. 
8. Billy logs into his email client, which queries the local **POP3/IMAP** server for new emails in his mailbox.
9. Alexa's email is copied (**IMAP**) or downloaded (**POP3**) to Billy's email client.


**Response**
- **Perform email analysis:** PhishTool retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities to follow the email’s actions, attachments, and URLs to triage the situation.
- **Heuristic intelligence:** OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a target.
- **Classification and reporting:** Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be shared.
