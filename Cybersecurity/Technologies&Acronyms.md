**==SSH==**
Secure Shell (SSH) refers to a cryptographic network protocol used in secure communication between devices. SSH encrypts data using cryptographic algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption System (AES) and is often used when logging in remotely to a computer or server.

**==SIEM==**
Security Information and Event Management system that is used to aggregate security information in the form of logs, alerts, artifacts and events into a centralized platform that would allow security analysts to perform near real-time analysis during security monitoring.
SIEM is used to provide correlation on the collected data to detect threats. Once a threat is detected, or a certain threshold is crossed, an alert is raised. This alert enables the analysts to take suitable actions based on the investigation. SIEM plays an important role in the Cyber Security domain and helps detect and protect against the latest threats in a timely manner. It provides good visibility of what's happening within the network infrastructure.
- Correlation between events from different log sources.
- Provide visibility on both Host-centric and Network-centric activities.
- Allow analysts to investigate the latest threats and timely responses.
- Hunt for threats that are not detected by the rules in place.


**==Splunk==**
Splunk is a platform for collecting, storing, and analyzing machine data. It provides various tools for analyzing data, including search, correlation, and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organizations of all sizes can use to improve their IT operations and security posture.


**==IR==**
Incident Response (IR) is a structured approach to managing and addressing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT incident, computer incident, or security incident. It involves identifying, investigating, handling, and learning from security events or incidents to prevent a similar occurrence.

**==SAM==**
The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8.1, 10 and 11 that stores users' passwords. It can be used to authenticate local and remote users.


**==APT==**
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.

**==MITRE==**
MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)
- ATT&CK_®_ (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
- D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

**==CTID==**
 [Center of Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) (CTID). This organization consists of various companies and vendors from around the globe. Their objective is to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs and share this research to improve cyber defense for all. 

Some of the companies and vendors who are participants of CTID:

- AttackIQ (founder)
- Verizon
- Microsoft (founder)
- Red Canary (founder)
- Splunk

**==Adversary Emulation Library & ATT&CK® Emulations Plans==**

The [Adversary Emulation Library](https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/introducing-the-all-new-adversary-emulation-plan-library-234b1d543f6b) is a public library making adversary emulation plans a free resource for blue/red teamers. The library and the emulations are a contribution from CTID. There are several [ATT&CK® Emulation Plans](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library) currently available: [APT3](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/adversary-emulation-plans/), [APT29](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/apt29), and [FIN6](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/fin6). The emulation plans are a step-by-step guide on how to mimic the specific threat group. If any of the C-Suite were to ask, "how would we fare if APT29 hits us?" This can easily be answered by referring to the results of the execution of the emulation plan.

**==IDS==**
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that detects unauthorised network and system intrusions. Examples include detecting unauthorised devices connected to the local network and unauthorised users accessing a system or modifying a file.

**==IPS==**
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a device or application that detects and stops intrusions attempts proactively. They are usually deployed in front of the protected asset and block any potential threat from reaching their target.

**==PCAP==**
Packet capture (PCAP) is a networking practice involving the interception of data packets travelling over a network. Once the packets are captured, they can be stored by IT teams for further analysis. The inspection of these packets allows IT teams to identify issues and solve network problems affecting daily operations.
